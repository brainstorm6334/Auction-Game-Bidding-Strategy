<p>You are in an auction bidding against other people in real time. The items you are bidding are paintings from four different artists (Rembrandt, Da Vinci, Picasso, and Van Gogh). All players start with $100 and bid some amount of money for each painting that comes up. The order in which the paintings come up is randomized in the beginning of the game, but is known to the player. The objective is to get 3 paintings from the same artist before anyone else. </p>

<p>The host and client must connect to the same network. The host modifies lines 12 and 13 in the server.py file to select number of players and the host's IP address respectively. Meanwhile, the client must modify line 10 in NewBot.py to match the host's IP address. After server.py has been executed by the host, the client must execute NewBot.py and enter his/her name. The game begins when <em>all</em> clients have connected to the server.</p>
